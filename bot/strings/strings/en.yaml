  <b>Sign Language</b>


  Use /{0}, navigate the menu, and choose your sign language.


  You can also change your sign language by typing its code as a command. For example, for American Sign Language, type
  /ase or /ASL.


  You can configure up to 3 sign languages. If a verse is not available in your first sign language, I will look for it
  in the next. Use


  <code>/{0} csg lsc asl</code>



  <b>Biblical Passages.</b>


  You can request up to 5 Bible verses in a single message. Use the full name of the biblical book or its abbreviation.


  You can also check Bible passages in other sign languages. For example:


  <code>/ase 1 Tim 2:6

  /hab 1 Tim 2:6</code>



  <b>Bot Language</b>


  I can send you Bible passages written in any language. And I can also converse with you in some languages.


  Click on /{1} or directly write the language code. For example, for English, you can write /en or /E. I will
  understand the books of the Bible you ask for in the language you have chosen.

  If you want to help translate the bot, leave me a comment /{2} and <a href="{3}">start translating</a>.
